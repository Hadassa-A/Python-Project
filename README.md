# Python Family Project

## Description
This Python project demonstrates object-oriented programming by implementing classes for **Family**, **Father**, **Mother**, and **Child**.  
The project allows user interaction for adding family members, managing children, and viewing parent/child details. It also includes iterators, file handling, and mathematical computations using **NumPy**.

---

## Features
- Create and manage **Father**, **Mother**, and **Child** objects.
- Build a **Family** with parents and multiple children.
- Store and retrieve parent and child information using **dictionaries**.
- Accept **user input** for family member details.
- Add, view, and iterate over children in the family.
- Compute mathematical functions like `sin(x)/x` and `cos(x)/x` using **NumPy**.
- Write and read data to/from a text file.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Python-Project.git
```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd Python-Project
```
3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

---

## Usage
1. Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```
2. Follow the prompts to:
   - Enter parent names and ages
   - Enter number of children and their details
   - View family information and children list
3. Perform calculations using `sin(x)/x` and `cos(x)/x` over a range
