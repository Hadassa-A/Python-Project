# Python Family Project

## Description
This Python project demonstrates object-oriented programming by implementing classes for **Family**, **Father**, **Mother**, and **Child**.  
The project allows user interaction for adding family members, managing children, and viewing parent/child details. It also includes iterators, file handling, and mathematical computations using **NumPy**.

---

## Features
- Create and manage **Father**, **Mother**, and **Child** objects.
- Build a **Family** with parents and multiple children.
- Store and retrieve parent and child information using **dictionaries**.
- Accept **user input** for family member details.
- Add, view, and iterate over children in the family.
- Compute mathematical functions like `sin(x)/x` and `cos(x)/x` using **NumPy**.
- Write and read data to/from a text file.
